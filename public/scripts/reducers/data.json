It is characterized by the deposition of a large amount of phospholipoproteinaceous material in the alveoli. There are several possible etiologies, both congenital and acquired. Alveolar macrophages play an important role in the clearance of surfactant. This is the first report of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in the feline species. Case presentation: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was diagnosed in an 8-month-old &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; with chronic tachypnea, failure to thrive and finally respiratory distress. The diagnosis was based on the milky appearance of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid taken under general anesthesia after bronchoscopy. Because of the worsening respiratory distress and development of anorexia the kitten was euthanized. Histopathology of the lungs showed alveoli and bronchi filled with eosinophilic material. Electron microscopy revealed lamellated intra-alveolar bodies. As the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was elevated in the serum and no autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were detected, a primary hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was suspected. The underlying cause was thought to be a dysfunction of the receptor of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, however, a mutation in the genes encoding the alpha and beta chains of this receptor has not been found. Conclusion: This is the first description of pulmonary alveolar protienosis in a &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;. This kitten is thought to have a primary hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis with a possible defect in the signalling pathway of the receptor of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The imaging and pathologic findings are similar to those of humans.

Before any necessary interventions to control the stray dogs and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, an accurate estimate of their populations should be attained. Yet, there is a very limited number of methods for an estimation. Some of them depend on the identification of marked or counted animals. However, problems arise when it is not possible to identify a previously captured animal. In this paper, we used a different approach to estimate the lower bound for the total number of dogs and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in consecutively visited settlements that might be useful for future studies internationally. It was estimated that there were 17,839 (95% CI: 14,862-20,816) stray dogs and 10,191 (95% CI: 8439-11,942) stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in Ankara, Turkey.

In Australia, feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; have caused decline and extinction of native mammals, but their time of introduction and origin is unclear. Here, we investigate hypotheses of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; arrival pre- or post-European settlement, and the potential for admixture between &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; of different invasion events. We analyse the genetic structure and diversity of feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from six locations on mainland Australia, seven Australian islands and samples from Southeast Asia and Europe using microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA data. Results: Our results based on phylogeographic model selection are consistent with a European origin of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in Australia. We find genetic distinctiveness of Australian mainland samples compared with Dirk Hartog Island, Flinders Island, Tasman Island and Cocos (Keeling) Island samples, and genetic similarities between some of the island populations. Historical records suggest that introduction of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; to these islands occurred at the time of European exploration and\/or in connection with the pearling, whaling and sealing trades early in the 19th century. On-going influx of domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; into the feral &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; population is apparently causing the Australian mainland populations to be genetically differentiated from those island populations, which likely are remnants of the historically introduced &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; genotypes. Conclusion: A mainly European origin of feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in Australia, with possible secondary introductions from Asia following the initial establishment of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in Australia is reasonable. The islands surrounding Australia may represent founding populations and are of particular interest. The results of the study provide an important timeframe for the impact of feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; on native species in Australia.

The interscapular region of the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; is a typical site of a highly invasive infiltrative pathology, i.e. Feline Injection-Site Sarcoma. Even if chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been considered as pre-surgical therapies, extensive surgery is still the recommended treatment. Evidence suggested that the relationships between muscles, infiltrative mass and adjacent musculoskeletal structures could change according to the forelimb positions: a fact to be duly considered while planning the surgical approach. Anatomic and tomographic atlases provide only images of the interscapular region from &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; positioned with their forelimbs extended cranially, which means that, they do not record musculoskeletal modifications due to the forelimb movements. Aim of this study was to provide detailed images of the changes occurring in the musculoskeletal structures of the interscapular region of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; according to their forelimb position by comparing cross-sectional gross anatomy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Results: We provide an atlas of normal cross-sectional anatomy, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the interscapular region of the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;, from the fifth cervical vertebra to the fifth thoracic vertebra. We compare and couple the slices obtained both in flexed and extended forelimb positioning with the animal maintained in sternal recumbency. Conclusion: This study shows a new and dynamic way to investigate the interscapular region of the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; and provides anatomical references for in vivo computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, considering changes in the muscular form according to the forelimb positioning. We believe that an in-depth anatomical knowledge of the interscapular region may be helpful to approach the study of any pathology located there and, in particular, to set up an appropriate therapy for the feline injection-site sarcoma.

The compositions of fatty acids (FAs) in the accumulated lipids in tissues of obese animals may have important roles in the process and mechanisms related to the onset of metabolic disorders. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a high fat (HF) diet, which contained a higher proportion of saturated FAs, on FA metabolism and distribution in obese &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (N = 12) were divided into control diet group (crude fat; 16.0 %) (n = 4) or a high fat (HF) diet group (crude fat; 23.9 %) (n = 8). The HF diet contained up to 60 % of calories from fat and was rich in stearic acid. Blood samples were collected at 0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the feeding. Adipose and liver tissues were collected at the 6th week after feeding. We performed analysis of histological findings and fatty acid composition in serum and tissues. Results: Body weights of the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; significantly increased in the HF group. The increased activities of hepatic enzymes and the accumulation of lipid droplets were found in hepatocytes in the HF group at the 6th week after feeding. In this study, the stearic acid (C18:0)-rich HF diet contained less oleic acid (C18:1n-9) and more linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) than the control. However, the composition of oleic acid in the liver was higher, and those of stearic acid and linoleic acid were lower in the HF group at the 6th week after feeding. The higher oleic acid:stearic acid ratio suggests an increase in the conversion from saturated FA to mono-unsaturated FAs, which may reflect the hepatic storage of FAs as a relatively harmless form. Conclusion: The stearic acid-rich HF diet increased hepatic lipid accumulation accompanied by the increased of hepatic oleic acid, increased serum oleic acid and activation of hepatic enzymes. These findings could be an important sign of early stages of dyslipidemia and hepatic damage. Also, the higher oleic acid:stearic acid ratio might be related to the increased activity of SCD-1, which suggests that the stearic acid-rich HF diet evoked hepatic lipogenesis in the feline liver.

Numerous reports suggest that papillomaviruses (PVs) are involved in their development.

Here we report a case of a FIV-positive &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; with skin fragility syndrome and regressing multiple viral plaques in which the contemporary presence of two PV types (FcaPV2 and FcaPV3) was demonstrated by combining a quantitative molecular approach to histopathology. The &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;, under glucocorticoid therapy for stomatitis and pruritus, developed skin fragility and numerous grouped slightly raised nonulcerated pigmented macules and plaques with histological features of epidermal thickness, mild dysplasia, and presence of koilocytes. Absolute quantification of the viral DNA copies (4555 copies\/microliter of FcaPV2 and 8655 copies\/microliter of FcaPV3) was obtained. Eighteen months after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy skin fragility and viral plaques had resolved. The role of the two viruses cannot be established and it remains undetermined how each of the viruses has contributed to the onset of VP; the spontaneous remission of skin lesions might have been induced by FIV status change over time due to glucocorticoid withdraw and by glucocorticoids withdraw itself.

Virus infection presents with flu-like signs and irritation of ocular and nasal regions. While &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; can recover from active infections without medical treatment, examination by a veterinarian is recommended. Lysine supplementation appears to be a popular intervention (recommended by &gt;90% of veterinarians in &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; hospitals). We investigated the scientific merit of lysine supplementation by systematically reviewing all relevant literature. Methods: NCBI&#39;s PubMed database was used to search for published work on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1, as well as lysine and human herpesvirus 1. Seven studies on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1 (two in vitro studies and 5 studies with &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;), and 10 publications on lysine and human herpesvirus 1 (three in vitro studies and 7 clinical trials) were included for qualitative analysis. Results: There is evidence at multiple levels that lysine supplementation is not effective for the prevention or treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Lysine does not have any antiviral properties, but is believed to act by lowering arginine levels. However, lysine does not antagonize arginine in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, and evidence that low intracellular arginine concentrations would inhibit viral replication is lacking. Furthermore, lowering arginine levels is highly undesirable since &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; cannot synthesize this amino acid themselves. Arginine deficiency will result in hyperammonemia, which may be fatal. In vitro studies with feline herpesvirus 1 showed that lysine has no effect on the replication kinetics of the virus. Finally, and most importantly, several clinical studies with &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; have shown that lysine is not effective for the prevention or the treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection, and some even reported increased infection frequency and disease severity in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; receiving lysine supplementation. Conclusion: We recommend an immediate stop of lysine supplementation because of the complete lack of any scientific evidence for its efficacy.

Hypothesis Long-term treatment of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD using telmisartan decreases urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ( UP\/C) similar to benazepril. Animals Two-hundred and twenty-four client-owned adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD. Methods Prospective, multicenter, controlled, randomized, parallel group, blinded clinical trial with noninferiority design. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were allocated in a 1 : 1 ratio to either telmisartan (1 mg\/kg; n = 112) or benazepril (0.5-1.0 mg\/kg; n = 112) PO q24 h. The primary endpoint was prospectively defined as the change in proteinuria (benazepril:telmisartan) based on a log transformed weighted average of UP\/C change from baseline ( AUC 0→t\/t) as a percentage compared using a confidence interval ( CI) approach. Changes of UP\/C from baseline were assessed on all study days and corrected for multiple comparisons. Results Telmisartan proved noninferior to benazepril in controlling proteinuria ( CI, −0.035 to 0.268). At Day 180, UP\/C compared to baseline in the telmisartan group was significantly lower (−0.05 &#177; 0.31; P = .016), whereas in the benazepril group the change (−0.02 &#177; 0.48) was not statistically significant ( P = .136). Similar results were obtained at all assessment points with significant decrease in UP\/C occurring with telmisartan but not benazepril. Conclusion and Clinical Importance Both telmisartan and benazepril were well tolerated and safe. Telmisartan proved to be noninferior to benazepril and significantly decreased proteinuria relative to baseline at all assessment points whereas benazepril did not.

The aims of the present study were to identify the species of ticks removed from &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; living in Sicily and Calabria (Italy) and to detect DNA of vector-borne pathogens in the same ticks. Findings: Morphological identification of 132 adult ticks collected throughout the year from &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; was carried out. Real-time PCRs for Hepatozoon felis, Piroplasmid, Ehrlichia\/Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Leishmania infantum were performed from each individual tick. Ticks belonging to Rhipicephalus (R. sanguineus sensu lato, R. pusillus) and Ixodes (I. ricinus, I. ventalloi) genera were identified. Ixodes ventalloi was the most frequently found tick species (47 %). The positivity rate to at least one pathogen was 14.4 % (19\/132 ticks). Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp. (R. monacensis and R. helvetica), Bartonella spp. (B. clarridgeiae), Piroplasmid (Babesia vogeli), and Ehrlichia\/Anaplasma spp. (E. canis) DNAs were amplified in 8.3, 5.3, 1.5, 0.75 and 0.75 % of ticks, respectively. Hepatozoon felis, Anaplasma spp. and hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. DNAs were not detected. Four (21.1 %) out of nineteen positive ticks were co-infected. Conclusions: This study provides novel data about ticks infesting &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and the DNA of pathogens that they harbor. In Southern Italy, anti-tick prophylaxis should be implemented throughout the year in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; without neglecting winter time.

Methods: twelve adult healthy Persian &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were selected. For scintigraphy, the animals were anesthetized and &lt;superscript&gt;99m&lt;\/superscript&gt;TC-DTPA was injected via the femoral vein as a bolus at a dose of 1.5 mCi. Immediately after intravenous injection of radiotracer, scintigraphic operation was conducted on the renal organ. dministration of the radioisotope and accumulation of radioisotope in the tissues was monitored by specific imaging theemanating Results: Distinct scintigraphic scans were obtained using &lt;superscript&gt;99m&lt;\/superscript&gt;TC-DTPA. Visual comparison of the scans indicates that there was no significant difference in the accumulation of radiotracer. In dynamic scans, symmetric and concurrent distribution of &lt;superscript&gt;99m&lt;\/superscript&gt;Tc-DTPA in the kidney was observed. Conclusion: The results show that the radiopharmaceutical &lt;superscript&gt;99m&lt;\/superscript&gt;Tc-DTPA is suitable for use in Persian &lt;highlight&gt;cat&#39;s&lt;\/highlight&gt; renal scintigraphy, and this makes it potentially useful in research and clinical practice.

euthanized in animal shelters is greater than that of kittens because adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; are less likely to be adopted. This study aimed to provide evidence to inform the design of strategies to encourage adult &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adoptions. One such strategy is to discount adoption prices, but there are concerns that this may result in poor adoption outcomes. We surveyed 382 &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adopters at the time of adoption, to assess potential determinants of adopters&#39; &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; age group choice (adult or kitten) and, for adult &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adopters, the price they are willing to pay. The same respondents were surveyed again 6-12 months after the adoption to compare outcomes between &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; age groups and between adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in two price categories. Most adopters had benevolent motivations for adopting from the shelter and had put considerable thought into the adoption and requirements for responsible ownership. However, adult &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adopters were more likely to have been influenced by price than kitten adopters. Adoption outcomes were generally positive for both adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and kittens and for adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; adopted at low prices. The latter finding alleviates concerns about the outcomes of &quot;low-cost&quot; adoptions in populations, such as the study population, and lends support for the use of &quot;low-cost&quot; adoptions as an option for attempting to increase adoption rates. In addition, the results provide information that can be used to inform future campaigns aimed at increasing the number of adult &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adoptions, particularly in devising marketing strategies for adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;.

In this study, prospective cross-sectional serologic survey and examination of local health authority records for CSD, the seroprevalence of antibodies against Bartonella henselae in pet and stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, and its public health aspect were investigated. Total antibodies to B. henselae were evaluated by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) in serum samples taken from 93 pet &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and 93 stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from the Sel&#231;uk University Veterinary Faculty Animal Hospital and Konya Municipality Stray Animal Shelter. Percentages of pet &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; seropositive for antibodies against Bartonella henselae (26.88% and 41.94%, respectively) were significantly higher than percentages of pet &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Total seroprevalence of Bartonella henselae was found to be 34.41% in the study. A total of 438 CSD cases were identified in the Konya region according to the data received from local health authority records in the previous 1.5 years (2011-2012). Stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; have higher seroprevalences of antibodies against Bartonella henselae, but this likely was related to greater exposure to vectors of these organisms. In conclusion, it was observed that CSD is an important risk for public health in Konya region. Therefore in order to decrease CSD prevalence in this region and prevent transmission of the disease to humans, information, treatment and prevention studies must be carried out within the One Health concept.

Yet, monitoring techniques for rare species which occur at extremely low densities are lacking. Additionally, species which have unpredictable movements may make obtaining reliable population estimates challenging due to low detectability. Our study explores the effectiveness of intensive camera trapping for estimating cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) numbers. Using both a more traditional, systematic grid approach and pre-determined, targeted sites for camera placement, the cheetah population of the Northern Tuli Game Reserve, Botswana was sampled between December 2012 and October 2013. Placement of cameras in a regular grid pattern yielded very few (n = 9) cheetah images and these were insufficient to estimate cheetah density. However, pre-selected cheetah scent-marking posts provided 53 images of seven adult cheetahs (0.61 &#177; 0.18 cheetahs\/100km&#178;). While increasing the length of the camera trapping survey from 90 to 130 days increased the total number of cheetah images obtained (from 53 to 200), no new individuals were recorded and the estimated population density remained stable. Thus, our study demonstrates that targeted camera placement (irrespective of survey duration) is necessary for reliably assessing cheetah densities where populations are naturally very low or dominated by transient individuals. Significantly our approach can easily be applied to other rare predator species.

The &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; history revealed that he had been treated with 500 IU hCG i.m. because he had to mate with three queens in a short period of time. In consideration of the mild symptoms, conservative treatment was adopted. The condition resolved in about 40 days. This is the first report of priapism following hCG administration in a &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; and indicates that the misuse of this gonadotropin might cause potentially harmful side effects.

Ovaj rad opisuje slučaj priapizma kod kratkodlakog persijskog mačora starosti 3 godine. Navedeno stanje je nastalo nakon pokušaja parenja sa ženkom pri kraju estrusa. Vlasnici su se obratili za stručnu pomoć 10 dana nakon nastanka simptoma. Predhodna terapija se sastojala u primeni kortikosteroida i lokalno lubrikanata. Tokom kliničkog pregleda mačor je bio budan i u svesnom stanju, penis je bio u erekciji i normalne boje. Analize krvi su isključile postojanje virusne etiologije. Anamneza je pokazala da je mačor tretiran sa 500 IU hCG i.m., s obzirom na to da je morao da se pari sa tri ženke tokom kratkog vremenskog perioda. Uzimajući u obzir blagu simptomatologiju, opredelili smo se za konzervativnu terapiju. Stanje se popravilo nakon 40 dana. Ovaj rad predstavlja prvi izveštaj priapizma nakon aplikacije hCG mačoru i ukazuje da zloupotreba ovog gonadotropina može da ima potencijalno štetne nuspojave.

The advantages of B-mode ultrasonography included: better qualitative and quantitative evaluation of pleural effusions, an improved ability to determine whether a nodule was solid or cystic and easier determination of the location in the pulmonary parenchyma. The Power Doppler ultrasound evaluated the blood supply pattern of the nodules and masses and differentiated between vessels and fluid bronchogram. A limitation of the ultrasound examination was the need to be guided by the previous radiography. The advantages of the radiographic examination included the possibility of localizing pulmonary lesions at any depth in the absence of a pleural effusion and providing a panoramic view of the extent of the thoracic disease.

Recent reports indicate that canine TSH ( cTSH) assays can be used to measure feline TSH and results can help diagnose or exclude hyperthyroidism. Objectives To investigate the usefulness of cTSH measurements as a diagnostic test for &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with hyperthyroidism. Animals Nine hundred and seventeen &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with untreated hyperthyroidism, 32 euthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; suspected of having hyperthyroidism, and 131 clinically normal &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Methods Prospective study. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; referred to the Animal Endocrine Clinic for suspected hyperthyroidism were evaluated with serum T&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt;, T&lt;subscript&gt;3&lt;\/subscript&gt;, free T&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt; ( fT&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt;), and TSH concentrations. Thyroid scintigraphy was used as the gold standard to confirm or exclude hyperthyroidism. Results Median serum TSH concentration in the hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (&lt;0.03 ng\/ mL) was significantly ( P &lt; .001) lower than concentrations in clinically normal &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (0.05 ng\/ mL) or euthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with suspected thyroid disease (0.06 ng\/ mL). Only 18 (2.0%) hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had measurable TSH concentrations (≥0.03 ng\/ mL), whereas 114 (69.9%) of the 163 euthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had detectable concentrations. Combining serum TSH with T&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt; or fT&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt; concentrations lowered the test sensitivity of TSH from 98.0 to 97.0%, but markedly increased overall test specificity (from 69.9 to 98.8%). Conclusions and Clinical Importance Serum TSH concentrations are suppressed in 98% of hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, but concentrations are measurable in a few &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with mild-to-moderate hyperthyroidism. Measurement of serum TSH represents a highly sensitive but poorly specific test for diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and is best measured in combination with T&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt; and fT&lt;subscript&gt;4&lt;\/subscript&gt;.

While their appetite for protein or savory flavors is consistent with their nutritional needs, their preference among protein-sufficient dietary options may relate to differences in the response to other flavor characteristics. Studies of domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; taste perception are limited, in part, due to the lack of receptor sequence information. Several studies have described the phylogenetic relationship of specific &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; taste receptor sequences as compared with other carnivores. For example, domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; are obligate carnivores and their receptor Tas1r2, associated with the human perception of sweet, is present only as a pseudogene. Similarly, the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; perception of bitter may differ from that of other mammals due to variations in their repertoire of bitter receptor (Tas2r) genes. This report includes the first functional characterization of domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; taste receptors. Results: We functionally expressed two uncharacterized domestic sequences Tas2r38 and Tas2r43 and deorphanized the receptors using a cellular functional assay. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired, two-tailed t-test. The &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; sequence for Tas2r38 contains 3 major amino acid residues known to confer the taster phenotype (PAI), which is associated with sensitivity to the bitter compounds PROP and PTC. However, in contrast to human TAS2R38, &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; Tas2r38 is activated by PTC but not by PROP. Furthermore, like its human counterpart, &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; Tas2r43 is activated by aloin and denatonium, but differs from the human TAS2R43 by insensitivity to saccharin. The responses of both &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; receptors to the bitter ligands were concentration-dependent and were inhibited by the human bitter blocker probenecid. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the response profiles of the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; bitter receptors Tas2r38 and Tas2r43 are distinct from those of their orthologous human receptors. Results with &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; Tas2r38 also demonstrate that additional residues beyond those classically associated with PROP sensitivity in humans influence the sensitivity to PROP and PTC. Functional studies of the human bitter receptor family are being applied to the development of food and medicinal products with more appealing flavor profiles. Our work lays the foundation for similar work applied to felines.

It is hypothesized that individuals with the lower expressing forms of the &lt;highlight&gt;CAT&lt;\/highlight&gt; polymorphism may be more susceptible to breast cancer. In order to find the allelic frequency of the C-262T polymorphism among Iranian populations, the present study was carried out. Methods: The total study subjects consisted of 1057, 200, and 200 individuals from Shiraz (Fars province; belong to Persians), Abarku (Yazd province; belong to Persians), and Yasuj (Kohgiluyeh va Boyer-Ahmad province; belong to Lurs), respectively. Genotypic analysis for the &lt;highlight&gt;CAT&lt;\/highlight&gt; C-262T polymorphism was determined by PCR. Results: The frequency of the T allele was 0.2044&#177;0.0138, 0.1825&#177;0.0193, and 0.1800&#177;0.0192 in Shiraz, Abarku, and Yasuj, respectively. The genotypic frequencies of the control subjects did not show significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Statistical analysis indicated that there was no significant difference between these populations for the genotypic distributions of the &lt;highlight&gt;CAT&lt;\/highlight&gt; C-262T polymorphism (χ&lt;superscript&gt;2&lt;\/superscript&gt;=2.73, df=4, P=0.603). Conclusion: The frequency of the T allele among Iranian populations was very similar to that reported for Caucasians and was higher than Asians and African-American populations.

The aetiology of FHN remains unclear, however it is suspected that FHN might occur secondary to intense epileptic activity as described in humans and dogs although this has not yet been documented in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. The purpose of our report is to describe the first cases of FHN in Finland diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histopathology. The two cases we describe had a well documented history of pre-existing seizures with normal brain MRI at the onset of cluster seizures but MRI done when the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; exhibited clinical deterioration secondary to severe seizure activity, revealed lesions in the hippocampus and piriform lobes typical of FHN. Our report confirms that feline hippocampus and piriform lobe necrosis does occur in the Finnish &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; population and should therefore be considered as a differential diagnosis in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with seizures. In addition, the presentation, clinical findings, results of MRI and\/or histopathology shows that &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; may develop FHN secondary to severe seizure activity.

Methods: The articles related to CSD were retrieved by search of four national (Ulakbim Turkish Medical Literature Databases*) and three international databases (Pub-Med, Science Citation Index (SCI) and Google scholar). Results: Between the years 1996-2013, CSD cases have been published in a total of 16 articles (4 international, 12 national). These articles which were presented as a case report included a total of 18 CSD cases (38.8% women, 61.2% men; median age 16 years). The most common clinicopathologic subtypes of CSD are regional lymphadenitis (n = 9), hepatosplenic (n = 3) and neuroretinitis (n = 2). The most common complaints of patients were swelling (94.4%), fever (61.2%) and weakness (50%) at admission. On exam, the most common signs were lymphadenopathy (94.4%), fever (61.2%), splenomegaly (16.6%), and skin eruption (16.6%). Conclusion: This pooled analysis which enabled the evaluation of a large number of CSD cases, indicated that careful evaluation of clinical findings and histopathological investigation will provide valuable support for diagnosis and treatment of CSD.

The mean number of prey brought home was 4.1 per &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; per month (excluding winter). Rodents were the most common prey (72 %), 18 % of prey being birds, 5.4 % insectivores, and the rest other mammals (hares, least weasels, pine martens, and a bat), reptiles or amphibians. Six &quot;super predator&quot; &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; accounted for 40 % of all prey items captured. There were no differences between the sexes in the number or diversity of prey brought home.

Owing to the pseudogenization of one of two subunits of the sweet receptor gene, they are indifferent to sweeteners, presumably having no need to detect plant-based sugars in their diet. Following this reasoning and a recent report of a positive correlation between the proportion of dietary plants and the number of Tas2r (bitter receptor) genes in vertebrate species, we tested the hypothesis that if bitter perception exists primarily to protect animals from poisonous plant compounds, the genome of the domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; (Felis catus) should have lost functional bitter receptors and they should also have reduced bitter receptor function. To test functionality of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; bitter receptors, we expressed &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; Tas2R receptors in cell-based assays. We found that they have at least 7 functional receptors with distinct receptive ranges, showing many similarities, along with some differences, with human bitter receptors. To provide a comparative perspective, we compared the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; repertoire of intact receptors with those of a restricted number of members of the order Carnivora, with a range of dietary habits as reported in the literature. The numbers of functional bitter receptors in the terrestrial Carnivora we examined, including omnivorous and herbivorous species, were roughly comparable to that of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; thereby providing no strong support for the hypothesis that a strict meat diet influences bitter receptor number or function. Maintenance of bitter receptor function in terrestrial obligate carnivores may be due to the presence of bitter compounds in vertebrate and invertebrate prey, to the necessary role these receptors play in non-oral perception, or to other unknown factors. We also found that the two aquatic Carnivora species examined had fewer intact bitter receptors. Further comparative studies of factors driving numbers and functions of bitter taste receptors will aid in understanding the forces shaping their repertoire.

However methodological problems in this latter research make the claim that the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-owner bond is typically a secure attachment, operationally definable by its behaviour in the SST, questionable. We therefore developed an adapted version of the SST with the necessary methodological controls which include a full counterbalance of the procedure. A cross-over design experiment with 20 &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-owner pairs (10 each undertaking one of the two versions of the SST first) and continuous focal sampling was used to record the duration of a range of behavioural states expressed by the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; that might be useful for assessing secure attachment. Since data were not normally distributed, non-parametric analyses were used on those behaviours shown to be reliable across the two versions of the test (which excluded much &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; behaviour). Although &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; vocalised more when the owner rather the stranger left the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; with the other individual, there was no other evidence consistent with the interpretation of the bond between a &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; and its owner meeting the requirements of a secure attachment. These results are consistent with the view that adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; are typically quite autonomous, even in their social relationships, and not necessarily dependent on others to provide a sense of security and safety. It is concluded that alternative methods need to be developed to characterise the normal psychological features of the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-owner bond.

Hypothesis\/Objectives To extend the clinical findings described in the report of 2000 on MG in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (J Am Vet Med Assoc 215:55-57). Animals Two hundred and thirty-five &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with MG. Methods Retrospective case study to evaluate the long-term outcome and incidence of spontaneous remission in myasthenic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Information including signalment, clinical presentation, presence of and type of cranial mediastinal mass, treatment including surgical versus medical, survival time, and outcome including spontaneous remissions was collected and analyzed in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; diagnosed at the Comparative Neuromuscular Laboratory, University of California San Diego by detection of acetylcholine receptor antibody titers &gt;0.3 nmol\/L by immunoprecipitation radioimmunosassay. Results Acquired MG in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; is associated with a euthanasia rate of 58%. Abyssinian and Somali &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had an increased incidence of MG compared to mixed breed &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; or &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; of other breeds. A cranial mediastinal mass, most commonly thymoma, was observed in 52% of the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, which is higher than in the previous report. Spontaneous remission is not a characteristic of MG in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Conclusions and clinical importance Myasthenia gravis in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; is a chronic disease associated with a high incidence of a cranial mediastinal mass. Spontaneous remission is not common and clinicians should warn owners of the necessity for long-term treatment. The clinical outcome with a cranial mediastinal mass did not differ between surgical or medical treatment.

Objectives To determine how feeding limited dietary iodine affects radioactive iodine uptake by the thyroid glands of hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Animals Eight geriatric &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with spontaneous hyperthyroidism. Methods Prospective study of eight client owned hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; fed a commercially available iodine limited diet for 6 months. Clinical signs were evaluated and TT4 and fT4 were measured during consumption of the diet. Uptake of &lt;superscript&gt;123&lt;\/superscript&gt;I was determined before and 8-16 weeks after exclusive consumption of the diet. Results Clinical signs of hyperthyroidism resolved in all &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, but there was no significant increase in body weight. TT4 and fT4 decreased into the reference range by 8-16 weeks in all &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Mean TT4 before consumption of the diet was 9.7 μg\/dL ( SD 5.2) and after consumption of the diet was 3.1 μg\/dL ( SD 0.9). Scintigraphy revealed unilateral uptake of isotope in 5 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and bilateral uptake in 3 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Mean percentage uptake of &lt;superscript&gt;123&lt;\/superscript&gt;I by the thyroid gland at 8 hours after isotope administration was 16.2 ( SD 11.8) before diet consumption and 34.6 ( SD 11.7) 8-16 weeks after exclusive consumption of the diet. The percentage increase was variable between &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (38-639%). Conclusions and clinical importance Limited iodine diets increase iodine uptake in the autonomous thyroid glands of hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Further studies are necessary to determine if consumption of a limited iodine diet changes sensitivity of the thyroid gland to &lt;superscript&gt;131&lt;\/superscript&gt;I treatment.

breeds (Felis catus). Collection of data from two affected Sphynx &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and their relatives pointed out a single disease candidate region on feline chromosome C2, identified following a genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity mapping strategy. In that region, we further identified COLQ (collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase) as a good candidate gene, since COLQ mutations were identified in affected humans and dogs with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency leading to a synaptic form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). A homozygous c.1190G&gt;A missense variant located in exon 15 of COLQ, leading to a C397Y substitution, was identified in the two affected &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. C397 is a highly-conserved residue from the C-terminal domain of the protein; its mutation was previously shown to produce CMS in humans, and here we confirmed in an affected Sphynx &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; that it induces a loss of acetylcholinesterase clustering at the neuromuscular junction. Segregation of the c.1190G&gt;A variant was 100% consistent with the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance of the disorder in our &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; pedigree; in addition, an affected, unrelated Devon Rex &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; recruited thereafter was also homozygous for the variant. Genotyping of a panel of 333 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from 14 breeds failed to identify a single carrier in non-Sphynx and non-Devon Rex &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Finally, the percentage of healthy carriers in a European subpanel of 81 genotyped Sphynx &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; was estimated to be low (3.7%) and 14 control Devon Rex &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were genotyped as wild-type individuals. Altogether, these results strongly support that the neuromuscular disorder reported in Sphynx and Devon Rex breeds is a CMS caused by a unique c.1190G&gt;A missense mutation, presumably transmitted through a founder effect, which strictly and slightly disseminated in these two breeds. The presently available DNA test will help owners avoid matings at risk.

These effects are poorly understood due to the difficulty of observing actual hunting behaviours. We attached collar-mounted video cameras to feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; living in a tropical savanna environment in northern Australia, and measured variation in hunting success among different microhabitats (open areas, dense grass and complex rocks). From 89 hours of footage, we recorded 101 hunting events, of which 32 were successful. Of these kills, 28% were not eaten. Hunting success was highly dependent on microhabitat structure surrounding prey, increasing from 17% in habitats with dense grass or complex rocks to 70% in open areas. This research shows that habitat structure has a profound influence on the impacts of small predators on their prey. This has broad implications for management of vegetation and disturbance processes (like fire and grazing) in areas where feral &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; threaten native fauna. Maintaining complex vegetation cover can reduce predation rates of small prey species from feral &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; predation.

Identification of genes that are differentially expressed in response to feeding is important for understanding flea biology and discovering targets for their control. Methods: C. felis fleas were maintained and fed for 24 h using an artificial rearing system. The technique of suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to screen for mRNAs specifically expressed in fed fleas. Results: We characterized nine distinct full-length flea transcripts that exhibited modulated or de novo expression during feeding. Among the predicted protein sequences were two serine proteases, a serine protease inhibitor, two mucin-like molecules, a DNA topoisomerase, an enzyme associated with GPI-mediated cell membrane attachment of proteins and a component of the insect innate immune response. Conclusions: Our results provide a molecular insight into the physiology of flea feeding. The protein products of the genes identified may play important roles during flea feeding in terms of blood meal digestion, cellular growth\/repair and protection from feeding-associated stresses.

This study measured the efficacy of fluralaner flavored chews (Bravecto&#174;, Merck Animal Health) administered to dogs against adult Ctenocephalides felis felis and egg production. Methods: Twelve purpose-bred dogs were randomly allocated to two groups of six dogs each. Dogs in treatment group 1 were administered a single fluralaner flavored chew to achieve a minimum dose of at least 25 mg\/kg while treatment group 2 served as untreated controls. On Days -2, 28, 56, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112, and 120 post-treatment, each dog was infested with approximately 200 unfed &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; fleas, C. felis felis (KS1 strain). Forty-eight hours after treatment and 48 h after each infestation, eggs were collected over a 3-h period, counted and viability determined. Dogs were combed to remove any remaining fleas. Results: Treatment of dogs with oral fluralaner provided a 100 % reduction in flea counts 48 h after treatment and within 48 h of every post-treatment infestation through Day122. Egg production from fluralaner treated dogs was reduced by 99.9 % (two eggs from one dog) within 48 h after treatment and not a single egg (100 % efficacy) was thereafter collected from treated dogs. Adult flea counts and egg production from the fluralaner-treated dogs were significantly lower than for non-treated controls at all post-treatment evaluations (P &lt; 0.001). The two eggs collected from the single treated dog 48 h after treatment did not produce any adult fleas. As no additional eggs were collected from treated dogs, no viability assessment was performed. Conclusions: A single oral dose of fluralaner flavored chews provided 100 % efficacy against repeated flea infestations on dogs for 4 months. Fluralaner reduced egg production of activity reproducing female fleas by 99.9 % and then killed every single female flea before any eggs could be produced following each subsequent re-infestation for the entire 122-day evaluation period.

An otherwise ordinary &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;—he&#39;d sooner give you his back or a sideways glance than curl up on your lap—Oscar has the uncanny ability to predict when people are about to die. Adopted by staff members at Steere House nursing home when he was a kitten, the three year-old &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; has presided over the deaths of more than twenty-five nursing home residents thus far. His mere presence at the bedside is viewed by physicians and nursing home staff as an almost absolute indicator of impending death – a blessing, really, because it allows staff members to notify families that the end is near. Oscar is highly regarded by the physicians and staff at Steere House and by the families of the residents whom he serves because he provides companionship to those who would otherwise have died alone.When Dr. David Dosa, an attending physician at Steere House, wrote about Oscar in the New England Journal of Medicine, the response was tremendous, with coverage everywhere from Today to People to CNN. Now Dr. Dosa expands his story, using the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; and the stories of several patients to examine end-of-life care as it exists today. Heartfelt, inspiring and sometimes even funny, it allows readers into a world rarely seen from the outside and often misunderstood."},{"Name":"Subject","Label":"Subjects","Group":"Su","Data":"&lt;searchLink fieldCode=&quot;DE&quot;

Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. Results: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCVsuspect\/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %\/8 %, FHV-1 20 %\/9 %, C. felis 8 %\/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %\/2 %, M. felis 47 %\/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %\/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: FCV was detected in less than half of the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multicat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.

Understanding people’s perception of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; ownership and the psychology underlying &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; semi-ownership could inform approaches to mitigate the negative effects of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; semi-ownership. The primary aims of this study were to investigate &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; ownership perception and to examine its association with human-&lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; interactions and caretaking behaviours. A secondary aim was to evaluate a definition of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; semi-ownership (including an association time of ≥1 month and frequent feeding), revised from a previous definition proposed in the literature to distinguish &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; semi-ownership from casual interactions with unowned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. &lt;highlight&gt;Cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; owners and semi-owners displayed similar types of interactions and caretaking behaviours. Nevertheless, caretaking behaviours were more commonly displayed towards owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; than semi-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, and semi-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were more likely to have produced kittens (p&lt;0.01). All interactions and caretaking behaviours were more likely to be displayed towards &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in semi-ownership relationships compared to casual interaction relationships. Determinants of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; ownership perception were identified (p&lt;0.05) and included association time, attachment, perceived &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; friendliness and health, and feelings about unowned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, including the acceptability of feeding unowned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Encouraging semi-owners to have the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; they care for sterilized may assist in reducing the number of unwanted kittens and could be a valuable alternative to trying to prevent semi-ownership entirely. Highly accessible semi-owner “gatekeepers” could help to deliver education messages and facilitate the provision of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; sterilization services to semi-owners. This research enabled semi-ownership to be distinguished from casual interaction relationships and can assist welfare and government agencies to identify &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; semi-owners in order to develop strategies to address this source of unwanted &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;.

Cross-sectional studies have suggested that blood pressure in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; increases with age. Hypothesis\/Objectives To determine whether blood pressure in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; increases with age and whether this occurs independently of the presence of CKD. To investigate risk factors for developing hypertension. Animals\/Subjects Two hundred and sixty-five &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD and 133 healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; ≥9 years were retrospectively identified. Methods Four groups were created according to status at initial evaluation ( CKD or healthy) and blood pressure at the last included visit (normotensive [ NT] or developed hypertension [ DH]): Healthy- NT, Healthy- DH, CKD- NT and CKD- DH. Systolic blood pressure ( SBP) over time slopes were compared with 0 and between groups. Risk factors for the development of hypertension were investigated, and associations of biochemical and clinical variables with SBP were examined. Results &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; that were hypertensive at CKD diagnosis (n = 105) were not included in further analyses. Twenty-seven &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD and 9 healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; developed hypertension ≥3 months after diagnosis of CKD or their first visit. Systolic blood pressure significantly increased with age in all &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; ( P &lt; .001). Healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were at less risk than &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD to become hypertensive (hazard ratio 0.2, P &lt; .001), with creatinine being an independent risk factor for the development of hypertension. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The high prevalence of hypertension in azotemic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in this study shows the importance of monitoring of SBP in elderly &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, and in particular in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with CKD.

As Crisp soon learns, each rescue mission from first to last is a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants experience, and no animal is truly safe until its paws touch American soil.

Objectives To determine the effect of feeding an iodine-restricted diet on TT4 concentrations and clinical signs in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with spontaneous hyperthyroidism. Animals Forty-nine client-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with spontaneous hyperthyroidism. Methods Retrospective case series. Hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were exclusively fed a commercially available iodine-restricted diet. Clinical response was assessed by change in weight and heart rate and serum TT4, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine concentrations at various times during dietary management (21-60 days, 60-180 days). Results Serum TT4 normalized in 20\/48 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (42%) and 39\/47 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (83%) at 21-60 days and 61-180 days, respectively. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in which the TT4 concentrations were still above reference range at 21-60 days had a significantly higher starting TT4 than those that normalized their TT4 levels during the same time period ( P = .038). Body weight did not significantly increase ( P = .34) nor heart rate decrease ( P = .64) during the study. There was a significant decrease in serum creatinine ( P = .028). &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in the low reference range for serum TT4 concentrations did not have a significant increase in body weight ( P = .41) nor creatinine ( P = .54) when compared to those with high reference range. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Restricted-iodine diets were effective at maintaining serum TT4 concentrations within reference ranges for a majority of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with spontaneous hyperthyroidism over 1 year, although not all clinical signs of hyperthyroidism improved.

Objectives To identify the prevalence of concurrent intra-abdominal disease using abdominal ultrasound examination ( AUS) in hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; referred for radioactive iodine treatment ( RIT) and to determine whether the requirement for pretreatment AUS is justified. Animals Five hundred and thirty-four client-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and referred for RIT. Methods Retrospective study. Age, breed, sex, body weight, clinical signs, total serum T4 concentration, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN) concentration, serum creatinine concentration, urine specific gravity ( USG), AUS results, and biopsy or cytology results, or both (if obtained) were collected from the medical records. Results The prevalence of concurrent disease identified using AUS in hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; referred for RIT was 36.1%; 22.8% of the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in the study had renal disease and 2.4% had confirmed neoplasia. Significant differences in median USG ( P value 0.032) and median BUN ( P value 0.028) were found between &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; that had abnormal kidneys on AUS compared to those with normal-appearing kidneys. Only 2.2% of the &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were not treated with RIT as a result of changes identified on AUS and subsequently obtained cytology or biopsy results. Conclusions and Clinical Importance The results indicate that pretreatment AUS in hyperthyroid &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; referred for RIT is unnecessary in most patients.

The present study aimed to standardize pregnancy detection in big &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; like the tiger (Panthera tigris), jaguar (Panthera onca) and lion (Panthera leo) using fecal samples. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) were performed to identify PGFM in feces. An EIA developed against 9α,11α-dihydroxy-15-oxo-prost-5-en-1-oic acid-BSA was used to assay PGFM in fecal samples of the Bengal tiger, Asiatic lion and jaguar. The PGFM levels increased after 9 weeks of pregnancy and remained elevated until parturition. All animals showed elevated levels of PGFM in the last trimester of pregnancy, thus making PGFM a reliable tool for pregnancy diagnosis during this period that can be useful in captive breeding programs in these species.

and humans poses a threat to public health because of the potential zoonotic transmission of influenza viruses to humans. Therefore, we examined the seroprevalence of pandemic H1N1\/09, canine H3N2, and human H3N2 viruses in pet &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in northern China from 2010 to 2014. Finding: Of 1794 serum samples, the seropositivity rates for H1N1\/09, canine H3N2, and human H3N2 were 5.7%, 0.7%, and 0.4%, respectively. The seropositivity rate for H1N1\/09 in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; was highest in 2010 (8.3%), and then declined continuously thereafter. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; older than 10 years were most commonly seropositive for the H1N1\/09 virus. Conclusions: Our findings emphasize the need for continuous surveillance of influenza viruses in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in China.

Cytology of a tracheobronchial brushing can detect inflammation in larger airways; however, evaluation of this technique has been limited in veterinary medicine. Objective To compare airway brush cytology to bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis in dogs and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with chronic cough. Animals Forty dogs and five &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; undergoing bronchoscopic investigation of chronic cough. Methods Prospective study. Bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed followed by tracheobronchial brushing of central airways. Results of cytologic assessment of BAL fluid and brush cytology were compared for the presence or absence of inflammation and concordance of inflammatory cell type. Results Brush cytology detected central airway inflammation in 34 of 40 (85%) dogs with inflammatory BAL fluid. However, the type of inflammation reported differed in 23 of 34 dogs. In five &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with inflammation in BAL fluid, brush cytology detected inflammation in four; the type of inflammation was discordant in all &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Conclusions and clinical relevance Brush cytology has good agreement with BAL regarding the presence of inflammation, although the type of inflammation detected with the different sampling techniques commonly varies. Brush cytology can provide supplementary information to BAL, and additional studies will provide further information on the role of tracheobronchial brush cytology in the diagnosis and management of respiratory conditions.

Robenacoxib is a NSAID with high selectivity for the cyclo-oxygenase-2 enzyme. In this study, the efficacy and safety of robenacoxib were evaluated in a prospective, randomised, active- and placebo-controlled masked clinical trial in 147 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; undergoing orthopaedic surgery. &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were randomised into two treatment groups: Group 1, robenacoxib (2 mg\/kg) administered via subcutaneous (s.c.) injection before surgery, followed by robenacoxib tablets (1-2.4 mg\/kg) administered post-operatively for approximately 9 days (n = 101) and Group 2, meloxicam (0.3 mg\/kg) administered s.c. before surgery, followed by placebo tablets administered post-operatively for approximately 9 days (n = 46). &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were assessed using numerical rating scales (NRSs) by clinicians before surgery and at 3, 8, 22 and 28 hours after surgery and at the final visit (VF on approximately Day 10), and daily by their owners from Day 1 to the VF. Results: The primary end point was the global investigator score which was the sum of clinician NRSs for posture, behaviour and pain on palpation\/manipulation. The efficacy of the single robenacoxib injection, assessed during 3 to 22 hours, was statistically non-inferior to meloxicam, with a relative efficacy of 1.029 (95% confidence interval, 0.847-1.231). No significant differences were detected during the follow-up treatment with robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days compared with placebo via clinician assessments at 28 hours and the VF, or in owner assessments on Days 1-VF. There were no significant differences in frequencies of reported adverse events, clinical observations and haematology or clinical chemistry variables between the groups. Conclusions: Single s.c. injection of robenacoxib before surgery had non-inferior efficacy compared with meloxicam in controlling post-operative pain and inflammation in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; undergoing orthopaedic surgery. Follow-up treatment with oral robenacoxib tablets for approximately 9 days was well tolerated, but there were no differences in the efficacy scores after Day 1 compared with the group receiving meloxicam s.c. followed by placebo control.

Teeth type (p &lt; 0.001) and diet (p &lt; 0.001) were found to be significant, however, age was not (p &gt; 0.05). Interactions were all significant: age x teeth (p &lt; 0.01), age &#215; diet (p &lt; 0.01), teeth &#215; diet (p &lt; 0.001), and teeth &#215; age &#215; diet (p &lt; 0.001). The probability of poor oral health is lower in the incisors of young or adult &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, fed a dry diet in comparison to the cheek teeth of older &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; fed a wet diet. Diet has a higher contribution to poor oral health than age. It is argued that &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;&#39; oral health may be promoted with an early age hygiene of the cheek teeth and with provision of abrasive dry food.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the fecal microbiome in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with diarrhea. Fecal samples were obtained from healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (n = 21) and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with acute (n = 19) or chronic diarrhea (n = 29) and analyzed by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and PICRUSt was used to predict the functional gene content of the microbiome. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) revealed significant differences in bacterial groups between healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with diarrhea. The order Burkholderiales, the families Enterobacteriaceae, and the genera Streptococcus and Collinsella were significantly increased in diarrheic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. In contrast the order Campylobacterales, the family Bacteroidaceae, and the genera Megamonas, Helicobacter, and Roseburia were significantly increased in healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with chronic diarrhea (&gt;21 days duration), while the class Erysipelotrichi and the genus Lactobacillus were significantly decreased in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with acute diarrhea. The observed changes in bacterial groups were accompanied by significant differences in functional gene contents: metabolism of fatty acids, biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids, metabolism of biotin, metabolism of tryptophan, and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, were all significantly (p&lt;0.001) altered in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with diarrhea. In conclusion, significant differences in the fecal microbiomes between healthy &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with diarrhea were identified. This dysbiosis was accompanied by changes in bacterial functional gene categories. Future studies are warranted to evaluate if these microbial changes correlate with changes in fecal concentrations of microbial metabolites in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with diarrhea for the identification of potential diagnostic or therapeutic targets.

Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has shown a promising diagnostic imaging technique to non-invasively and repetitively quantify tissue perfusion. Examination protocols have varied between studies regarding US equipment, quantification software, the use of sedation or anaesthesia, and animals. The purpose of the present study was, to assess the feasibility of a standardized CEUS protocol for perfusion analysis of both kidneys in nine healthy, non-anaesthetized &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Results: CEUS was fairly tolerable for all but one &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;. In 6\/18 kidneys (2 left, 4 right), a second contrast medium injection was needed due to motion artifacts. Perfusion variables such as peak intensity (PI), wash-in slope (WIS), wash-out slope (WOS) and mean transit time (MTT) did not significantly differ between left and right renal cortex and medulla nor between the cranial and caudal renal cortex within each kidney. In contrast, for all kidneys, mean PI, WIS, and MTT were significantly higher in the cortex than in the medulla (P = 0.001, 0.012 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Conclusions: The herein reported CEUS protocol and the perfusion measurements may serve as a baseline protocol and normal reference values for the evaluation of feline patients. However, the protocol and results may be of limited value in uncooperative animals.

The PEMT expression is known to be upregulated by oestrogens, protecting the females in these species from the development of HL when exposed to choline deficient diets. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of sex hormones on choline synthesis via the PEMT pathway in healthy male and female &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; before and after spaying\/neutering, when fed a diet with recommended dietary choline content. Results: From six female and six male &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; PEMT activity was assayed directly in liver biopsies taken before and after spaying\/neutering, and assessed indirectly by analyses of PEMT-specific hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) species and plasma choline levels. Hepatic PEMT activity did not differ between intact female and male &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and no changes upon spaying\/neutering were observed. Likewise, no significant differences in liver PC content and PEMT-specific polyunsaturated PC species were found between the sexes and before or after spaying\/neutering. Conclusion: These results suggest that choline synthesis in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; differs from what is observed in humans, mice and rats. The lack of evident influence of sex hormones on the PEMT pathway makes it unlikely that spaying\/ neutering predisposes &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; for HL by causing PC deficiency as suggested in other species.

However, tetracyclines may cause gastrointestinal side effects, such as vomiting, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, and increased liver enzyme activity in some pets. We evaluated the effect of a four-week treatment regimen with roxithromycin - RXM (Rulid&#174; Sanofi-Aventis, France) in 14 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with conjunctivitis that tested C. felis-positive, and exhibited doxycycline intolerance. The treatment was given for four weeks. Assessment of clinical disease was performed on Day 0 and Day 56. Changes in severity of clinical signs were assessed on a threestep scale (increased, decreased, or no changes) every week of the therapy (Days 7, 14, 21, and 28). Additionally, conjunctival swabs were collected on Days 0 and 56 from each animal, and the C. felis-count was assessed through amplification of the ompA gene by real-time PCR with fluorogenic probes and normalisation to the feline DNA signal. Animals receiving RXM improved regarding the ophtalmological parameters related to manifestation of conjunctivitis, severity of ocular discharge and nasal discharge and breathing patterns (P ≤ 0.05). A visible improvement in relation to these parameters was already observed after two weeks of RXM administration. C. felis-counts decreased in nine &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; that were given RXM, but in the other five C. felis was not eliminated. Interestingly, however, aggravation of symptoms was not observed in these five animals. Further studies are needed to fully confirm that a reduction of clinical signs and pathogen counts under conditions of natural infection can be attributed to RXM treatment, since there was no control group that received placebo or another drug in this study. The present results also indicate that in some cases 28 days of RXM administration will not be sufficient to eliminate infection.

The aim of this study was to estimate patterns of seroprevalence to feline viruses (feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus (FCV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline leukemia virus (FeLV)) in two &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; species, domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; ( Felis catus L., 1758) ( n = 61) and Pallas&#39; &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; ( Otocolobus manul (Pallas, 1776)) ( n = 24), living in the same area, in Daursky Reserve, Russia. Our results indicate that four of five viruses are circulating in the study area, with the exception of FHV. The pattern of FCV and FPV prevalence differed from FIV and FeLV. FCV and FPV seroprevalence did not depend on the sex and predominated in the group of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; living in the village (76% and 55%, respectively). No Pallas&#39; &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were seropositive to these viruses. The prevalence of FIV and FeLV were similar in areas with different &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; densities (at the stations (16% for both viruses) and in the village (16% for both viruses)). The patterns of seroprevalence between species testify to the low rate of interspecific contacts. In Pallas&#39; &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, we found the presence of antibodies to FIV to be 5% and antigens of FeLV to be 5%, pathogens for which transmission demand close direct contacts between animals (mainly aggressive and (or) sexual contact), which is typical in the breeding season. Arid climate may also reduce patterns of viral prevalence in the study area, decreasing the risk of infection for both &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; species.

Five groups were fed once daily with a commercial diet containing 0.2% phosphorus (&quot;standard diet&quot;) into which was mixed Lenziaren&#174; at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 g\/day or no treatment (control group) daily for 30 days. A sixth group was fed a commercial diet containing lower amounts (0.12%) of phosphorus (&quot;renal diet&quot;) and no treatment. Results When compared to the control group, Lenziaren&#174; produced significant dose-related reductions in urine phosphate concentrations, urine phosphate excretion and fractional urinary phosphate excretion. Significant effects versus the control group were observed at the 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 g\/day dosages. Lenziaren&#174; was well tolerated and was associated with higher food consumption and serum iron concentrations versus the control. When compared to the control group, the renal diet was associated with significantly lower urine phosphate concentrations and loss of body weight. Lenziaren&#174; had similar effects on urine phosphate concentrations compared to the renal diet, but was not associated with loss of body weight. Conclusions Lenziaren&#174; was effective as an oral phosphate binder in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; fed with a standard diet containing 0.2% phosphorus. The acceptability and tolerability were good. Dosages of 0.5- 1.0 g\/&lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; per day are recommended for clinical testing in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; fed with a standard diet.

Although the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is considered as enzootic in domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (Felis silvestris catus) living in some areas of continental Greece, conversely, Troglostrongylus brevior, has only been reported in the island of Crete. The present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior in domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from four different Greek locations including islands where European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), believed to be the natural reservoir of T. brevior, are considered absent. Methods: Faeces were collected from 125 stray &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in the city of Athens, and in Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos Islands, and examined by copromicroscopic techniques for the presence of lungworm larvae. When present, larvae were morphologically and molecularly identified. Results: The occurrence of A. abstrusus and T. brevior was confirmed in 10 (8 %) and 7 (5.6 %) of the samples, respectively. In particular, T. brevior was detected in domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; in the city of Athens, and in Mykonos and Skopelos Islands, where wildcats are not present. Conclusions: This information illustrates that T. brevior may infect domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; regardless of the presence of the natural host. Considering the relevant clinical impact of this nematode especially in young animals, it is advisable to include troglostrongylosis in the differential diagnosis of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; respiratory diseases also where this parasite is unexpected.

Owners who let their &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; roam, also place their &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; at risk of serious injury. One management strategy that is gaining considerable support involves encouraging &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; owners to contain their pets within their property. Contemporary behaviour change models highlight the importance of identifying drivers and barriers that encourage and discourage target behaviours such as &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; containment. Results from a random dial phone survey of 356 &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; owners in northern Tasmania identified four distinct &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; containment profiles: owners who contained their &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; all the time, owners who only contained their &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; at night, owners who sporadically contained their &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; with no set routine, and owners who made no attempt to contain their pet. Our results indicated that &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-owners’ decisions to contain or not contain their &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were guided by a range of factors including owners’ beliefs about their ability to implement an effective containment strategy and their views about the physical and psychological needs of their &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. The results are discussed in terms of improving the behavioural effectiveness of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; containment interventions by selecting appropriate behavioural change tools for the identified drivers and barriers, and developing targeted engagement strategies and messaging.

This review surveys the current status of several areas of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; cognition research including perception, object permanence, memory, physical causality, quantity and time discrimination, &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;&#39; sensitivity to human cues, vocal recognition and communication, attachment bonds, personality, and cognitive health. Although interest in &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; cognition is growing, we still have a long way to go until we have an inclusive body of research on the subject. Therefore, this review also identifies areas where future research must be conducted. In addition to the scientific value of future work in this area, future research on &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; cognition could have an important influence on the management and welfare of pet and free-roaming &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, leading to improved human-&lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; interactions.

Of those adopted, the greatest risk to post-adoption human animal bond is unrealistic expectations set by the adopter. The ASPCA&#174;&#39;s Meet Your Match&#174; Feline-ality™ adoption program was developed to provide adopters with an accurate assessment of an adult &lt;highlight&gt;cat&#39;s&lt;\/highlight&gt; future behavior in the home. However, the original Feline-ality™ required a three-day hold time to collect &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; behaviors on a data card, which was challenging for some shelters. This research involved creating a survey to determine in-home feline behavior post adoption and explored the predictive ability of the in-shelter assessment without the data card. Our results show that the original Feline-ality™ assessment and our modified version were predictive of feline behavior post adoption. Our modified version also decreased hold time for &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; to one day. Shelters interested in increasing &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; adoptions, decreasing length of stay and improving the adoption experience can now implement the modified version for future feline adoption success.

It is possible that viewing of online &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; media improves mood, but this activity may also foster negative outcomes linked to using the Internet for procrastination. The present survey of Internet users ( N = 6795) explored the correlates of viewing “Internet &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;,” motivations for consuming this media, and its potential effects on users. It also tested a conceptual model predicting enjoyment as a function of the relationships between procrastination, guilt, and happiness.

Most affected &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; suffer from a type of diabetes similar to type 2 diabetes in humans. An increasing prevalence has been described in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, as in humans, related to obesity and other lifestyle factors. Objectives To describe the incidence of DM in insured Swedish &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; and the association of DM with demographic risk factors, such as age, breed and sex. Animals A cohort of 504,688 individual &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; accounting for 1,229,699 &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-years at risk ( CYAR) insured by a Swedish insurance company from 2009 to 2013. Methods We used reimbursed insurance claims for the diagnosis of DM. Overall incidence rates and incidence rates stratified on year, age, breed, and sex were estimated. Results The overall incidence rate of DM in the cohort was 11.6 cases (95% confidence interval [ CI], 11.0-12.2) per 10,000 CYAR. Male &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had twice as high incidence rate (15.4; 95% CI, 14.4-16.4) as females (7.6; 95% CI, 6.9-8.3). Domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were at higher risk compared to purebred &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. A significant association with breed was seen, with the Burmese, Russian Blue, Norwegian Forest &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;, and Abyssinian breeds at a higher risk compared to other &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. No sex predisposition was found among Burmese &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Several breeds with a lower risk of DM were identified. Conclusions and clinical importance Our results verify that the Burmese breed is at increased risk of developing DM. We also identified several previously unreported breeds with increased or decreased risk of DM.

Authors suggested that infection with &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; parasite Toxoplasma could be the reason for this association. Method: A cross sectional internet study on a non-clinical population of 5,535 subjects was undertaken. Results: The subjects that reported having been bitten by a dog and a &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; or scratched by a &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; have higher Beck depression score. They were more likely to have visited psychiatrists, psychotherapists and neurologists in past two years, to have been previously diagnosed with depression (but not with bipolar disorder). Multivariate analysis of models with &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; biting, &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; scratching, toxoplasmosis, the number of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; at home, and the age of subjects as independent variables showed that only &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; scratching had positive effect on depression (p = 0.004). &lt;highlight&gt;Cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; biting and toxoplasmosis had no effect on the depression, and the number of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; at home had a negative effect on depression (p = 0.021). Conclusions: Absence of association between toxoplasmosis and depression and five times stronger association of depression with &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; scratching than with &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; biting suggests that the pathogen responsible for mood disorders in animals-injured subjects is probably not the protozoon Toxoplasma gondii but another organism; possibly the agent of &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt;-scratched disease – the bacteria Bartonella henselae.

Only 28% of dogs and 9% of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were microchipped, and a substantial proportion (37%) had problems with their data, including being registered to a previous owner or organisation (47%), all phone numbers incorrect\/disconnected (29%), and the microchip not registered (14%). A higher proportion of owners could be contacted when the microchip had no problems, compared to those with problems (dogs, 93% vs. 70%; &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;, 75% vs. 41%). The proportion of animals reclaimed declined significantly between microchipped animals with no data problems, microchipped animals with data problems and non-microchipped animals--87%, 69%, and 37%, respectively, for dogs and 61%, 33%, and 5%, respectively, for &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;.

The &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; had been hit by an automobile 10 days earlier. A thoracic radiograph suggested stenosis of the intrathoracic trachea, proximal to the tracheal bifurcation. Endoscopic examination confirmed a narrowing of the tracheal lumen due to the presence of a fibrotic ring, with remaining patent lumen of about 2 mm. A surgical treatment with a right lateral thoracotomy approach and resection of the narrowed portion of the trachea (a length of about 1 cm) was performed under endoscopic vision. The procedure was unsuccessful because of the size of the tissue removed and the laxity of the remaining tracheal tissue that caused dehiscence of sutures between the tracheal stump and tracheal bifurcation. After consultation with the &lt;highlight&gt;cat&#39;s&lt;\/highlight&gt; owners, an intraoperative euthanasia was performed.

The aggressive and avoidance-related behaviours exhibited by companion animals that are overt responders to stress within the veterinary practice form a key factor in owners delaying or avoiding presenting companion animals for veterinary treatment (Landsberg et al, 2013). The veterinary profession has access to the majority of these animals and their owners at the time when the young animals&#39; emotional and behavioural development is at its most sensitive to social and environmental influences, making the education of owners regarding stress, and its implications for their pet, a major responsibility of the veterinary team. The first article in this series explained the incidence and potential outcomes of stress on the companion animal. This article suggests practical interventions for the veterinary team. By demonstrating sensitivity to and effective management of stressed patients, the veterinary team become an effective teaching tool influencing owner behaviour towards their companion animals.

Hypothesis\/Objectives We hypothesized that Bartonella exposure is associated with more severe degenerative joint disease ( DJD) and a greater burden of DJD-associated pain in client-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Animals Ninety-four client-owned &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; (6 months to 20 years old), ranging from clinically unaffected to severely lame because of DJD. Methods Using physical examination and radiography, pain and radiographic scores were assigned to each part of the bony skeleton. Sera were tested for Bartonella henselae, B. koehlerae, and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (genotypes I, II, and III) antibodies using immunofluorescence antibody assays. Variables were categorized and logistic regression used to explore associations. Results Seropositivity to Bartonella was identified in 33 (35.1%) &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. After multivariate analysis controlling for age, total DJD score (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.26-0.97; P = .042), appendicular pain score (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.17-0.65; P = .0011), and total pain score (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.72; P = .0045) were significantly inversely associated with Bartonella seroreactivity status, indicating that &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with higher DJD and pain scores were less likely to be Bartonella seropositive. Conclusions and Clinical Importance Based upon this preliminary study, Bartonella spp. seropositivity was associated with decreased severity of DJD and decreased DJD-associated pain in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt;. Additional studies are needed to verify these findings, and if verified, to explore potential mechanisms.

can cause fever, lethargy, depression, inappetence, icterus, and often death. With a high mortality rate, cytauxzoonosis was historically considered a fatal disease. Within the last 15 years, &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; with or without treatment have been recognized as chronically infected survivors of C. felis infection. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of C. felis in healthy domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. Methods Infection with C. felis was determined using DNA extracted from anticoagulated whole blood and PCR amplification using C. felis-specific primers. Chi-square, Fisher&#39;s exact tests, and odds ratios were used to compare proportions of &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; infected with C. felis. Results Blood samples were collected from 902 healthy domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; between October 2008 and April 2012. DNA from Cytauxzoon felis was detected in 56 of 902 (6.2%; 95% confidence interval, 4.7-7.9) samples. The highest prevalence of C. felis infection (15.5%; 10.3-21.7) was observed in &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from Arkansas, followed by &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from Missouri (12.9%; 6.1-24.0), and &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from Oklahoma (3.4%; 2.2-5.1). &lt;highlight&gt;Cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; sampled in Arkansas and Missouri were 5.1 and 4.2, respectively, times more likely to be chronically infected with C. felis than &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; from Oklahoma. Conclusions Infection with C. felis is common in domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; through Arkansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. The high prevalence of C. felis reported herein suggests that infected domestic &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; are likely reservoirs of infection for naive felines. The high prevalence of C. felis substantiates the importance for the use of approved acaricides on &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; to prevent cytauxzoonosis.

Because obesity is related to several other diseases, it is important to identify the population at risk. Several risk factors for obesity have been described in the literature. A higher incidence of obesity in certain &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; breeds has been suggested. The aim of this study was to determine whether obesity occurs more often in certain breeds. The second aim was to relate the increased prevalence of obesity in certain breeds to the official standards of that breed. To this end, 268 &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; of 22 different breeds investigated by determining their body condition score ( BCS) on a nine-point scale by inspection and palpation, at two different &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; shows. Overall, 45.5% of the show &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had a BCS &gt; 5, and 4.5% of the show &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; had a BCS &gt; 7. There were significant differences between breeds, which could be related to the breed standards. Most overweight and obese &lt;highlight&gt;cats&lt;\/highlight&gt; were in the neutered group. It warrants firm discussions with breeders and &lt;highlight&gt;cat&lt;\/highlight&gt; show judges to come to different interpretations of the standards in order to prevent overweight conditions in certain breeds from being the standard of beauty. Neutering predisposes for obesity and requires early nutritional intervention to prevent obese conditions.
